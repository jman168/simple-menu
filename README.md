# simple-menu
A super simple menu system for C++

This is a library I created for my COP2228 programming II class. It is very crude, but it is designed to allow for very simple clean quick coding of crude menus and works quite well for that purpose.

**DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.** It is by no means built for production, nor is it production ready. Think of this *only* as a simple library for building simple menus for testing code.
